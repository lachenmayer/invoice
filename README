Generates invoices for me by reading the required details from YAML files,
generating HTML & CSS, serving the resulting page & opening the browser's
print preview, where I can then save it as PDF.

This is probably not useful to anyone else.
You can try it out with the example YAML file in this repo if you want.

To install:

$ npm install -g https://github.com/lachenmayer/invoice
