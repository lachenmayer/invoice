Generates invoices for me by reading the required details from YAML files.

PDF files are generated using react-pdf.

This is probably not useful to anyone else.

To try it out, clone the repo and run:

$ npm install
$ npm run dev

This will open a sample invoice in your browser.

To install:

$ npm install -g https://github.com/lachenmayer/invoice

To use:

$ invoice example.yaml
